# Gyrowin Freezelock Contract

Freeze lock has been developed by Gyrowin dev team.
Freeze lock unlocks tokens for adding liquidity or any platform related task. A cooling period is set for every request before it gets unlocked for use.
Set it to 7 day and renounced control it on the smart contract. So what this means is that team would be able to use those token only after 7 days of request made to lock smart contract. The contract function emits events details about unlocked token amount, which will alert our token holders. And also give them enough time to react on the situation.
